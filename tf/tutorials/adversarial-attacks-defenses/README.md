# Implementing Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Keras & Tensorflow 2.0
#### From 90% Accuracy to 20%

Available here: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/implementing-adversarial-attacks-and-defenses-in-keras-tensorflow-2-0-cab6120c5715

## Requirements
* Tested in Python 3.7.7 (pretty much any version of Python 3 should work)
* tensorflow==2.1.0
* matplotlib==3.2.0

The code will likely still work with other versions of these packages, but that hasn't been tested.  If you have a capable GPU, you can substitute `tensorflow` with `tensorflow-gpu`.

### Conda Instructions
```
conda create -n adversarial-attacks-defenses -y python=3.7.7
conda activate adversarial-attacks-defenses
conda install -y tensorflow==2.1.0
conda install -y -c conda-forge matplotlib==3.2.0
```
