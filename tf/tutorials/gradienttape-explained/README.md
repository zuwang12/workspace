# tf.GradientTape Explained for Keras Users
#### A must know guide for advanced optimization in TF 2.0

Available here: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/tf-gradienttape-explained-for-keras-users-cc3f06276f22

## Requirements
* Tested in Python 3.7.7 (pretty much any version of Python 3 should work)
* tensorflow==2.1.0

The code will likely still work with other versions of these packages, but that hasn't been tested.  If you have a capable GPU, you can substitute tensorflow with tensorflow-gpu.

```
conda create -n gradienttape-explained -y python=3.7.7
conda activate gradienttape-explained
conda install -y tensorflow==2.1.0
```
